  ## Installation
  Pull the repository.  Install the dependencies and run MySQL shell and CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db.  Set the server sequelize.sync to true and run npm start.  This will create the necessary tables inside the database.  Shut off the server and run node seeds/index.js to seed the database tables.  Change the server.js sequelize.sync back to false and run the application using npm start command in the terminal.

  ## Usage
  You can test the api routes using Insomnia.  API routes are localhost:3002/api/products, ...api/categories, & ...api/tags.
